  **Algorithm:** Train a VGG16 model from scratch. Your testing accuracy must cross 60%. Hint: You may modify the architecture.


  **Training:** Train the model on coloured images.


  **Testing:** Test the model on gray-scaled images. You can concatenate the gray scale images to make number of channels as 3.


  **Evaluation:** Perform a 10-class classification using VGG16 model on cifar10 dataset
