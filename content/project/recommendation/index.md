summary: >-
  

  **Algorithm:** Train a VGG16 model from scratch. Your testing accuracy must cross 60%. Hint: You may modify the architecture.


  **Training:** Train the model on coloured images.


  **Testing:** Test the model on gray-scaled images. You can concatenate the gray scale images to make number of channels as 3.


  **Evaluation:** Perform a 10-class classification and report the performance as follows:


  **1. Perform 10 class classification using the above neural network, with the final node being a sigmoid activation. Keep the loss function as the mean square error. Use the testing set to report accuracy.**


  **2. Test the above model on the testing set of gray-scaled images.**


  **3. Report class-wise accuracy.**


  **4. Do you think there is any kind of bias in the system? Evaluate the system using 3 different evaluation metrics to see if there is any bias or not.**


  **5. (Bonus) Come up with a new evaluation metric to detect if there is a bias in the system.**


  **6. If you observed any bias in the system, mitigate the bias by:**


  **• DATA method (Pre-Processing): You may use any of the pre-processing technique to achieve your aim.**


  **• ALGORITHMIC method: You can alter loss function or use a multi tasking approach to achieve the goal.**
